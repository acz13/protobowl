For a Hausdorff space X, the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem gives the conditions under which a subalgebra of C(X,R) has this property. If every nonempty open set in a topological space has this property, then the space is said to be hyperconnected. A set is called \"nowhere this\" if the interior of its closure is empty. On a metric space X, a set Y has this property if and only if every element in X is the limit of a sequence of elements in Y. For 10 points, identify this topological property that describes a set whose closure is the whole space to which it belongs, as exemplified by the rational numbers on the reals.", "round" : "2010 - Chicago Open - Round 14 - The Gorilla Wrestles With The Superman.doc", "seen" : 32, "tournament" : "Chicago Open", "type" : "qb", "year" : 2010 }
