R. Williams has pioneered a method to use these entities to induce gas phase dissociation for tandem mass spectroscopy. Sakuma and Hattori name a formula for determining the radiative flux of one of these objects in terms of temperature. These objects were empirically modeled by a law named for Planck, while a first-order approximation to that formula proved to be essential in the development of quantum mechanics, as the Rayleigh-Jeans law predicted an unphysical “ultraviolet catastrophe”. The heat emitted by one of these is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
